**Audience:** Technical and non-technical viewers

## Pre-Demo Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Load the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `chrome-extension` folder
6. Pin the Halo extension to toolbar (puzzle piece icon → pin)

3. Keep extension popup accessible

## Demo Script

### Opening Hook (15 seconds)

> **"Every day, cybercriminals send millions of fake meeting links to steal credentials and compromise systems. What if your browser could instantly tell you which links are safe?"**

_Open the test page showing mixed verified/unverified links_

### The Problem (30 seconds)

> **"Here's what your inbox looks like today - meeting links everywhere. But which ones can you trust?"**

_Point to the unverified links on the page_

> **"This urgent security meeting link looks legitimate, but there's no way to verify the sender's identity. One click could compromise your entire organization."**

### The Solution - Halo in Action (60 seconds)

#### 1. Real-time Scanning

> **"Watch what happens when Halo scans this page..."**

_Reload the page or trigger manual scan_

-   Point out the extension automatically detecting meeting links
-   Show loading badges appearing briefly

#### 2. Trust Badges Appear

> **"Instantly, Halo shows you exactly which links are safe!"**

_Point to the dramatic visual difference:_

-   ✅ **GREEN "VERIFIED" badges** - "These links are cryptographically verified by their creators"
-   ❌ **RED "UNVERIFIED" badges** - "These links have no verification and could be malicious"

#### 3. Detailed Verification

> **"Click any badge for detailed information..."**

_Click a verified badge to show modal_

-   Creator's wallet address
-   Verification timestamp
-   Platform detection
-   Trust level

_Click an unverified badge_

-   Clear warning about potential risks
-   No creator information available

### The Technology (30 seconds)

> **"Halo uses zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain credentials to verify meeting links without exposing sensitive information. Legitimate senders can prove their identity, while scammers cannot."**

_Show extension popup with statistics_

-   Links scanned
-   Threats blocked
-   Success rate

### Real-World Impact (15 seconds)

> **"In this demo, we prevented potential clicks on 2 unverified links that could have been phishing attempts. Halo provides instant protection across Gmail, Discord, Teams, and other platforms."**

### Call to Action (10 seconds)

> **"Halo represents the future of social engineering protection - proactive, cryptographic verification that works automatically in your browser."**

## Backup Scenarios

### If Extension Doesn't Load

-   Use screenshot/video of working demo
-   Emphasize the concept and protection value
-   Show the test HTML page as proof of concept

### If API is Down

-   Mention that extension has fallback verification methods
-   Show cached results or local validation
-   Emphasize the resilience of the system

### If Demo Goes Too Fast

-   Slow down at the badge appearance moment
-   Give audience time to see the red vs green contrast
-   Repeat the key message about verified vs unverified

## Success Metrics

### Audience Engagement

-   **"Wow" moment:** Visible reaction when badges appear
-   **Questions about verification:** How does it work?
-   **Interest in implementation:** Can this be deployed?

### Technical Demonstration

-   ✅ Extension loads successfully
-   ✅ Page scanning works automatically
-   ✅ Trust badges appear with correct colors
-   ✅ Modal popups show detailed information
-   ✅ Statistics tracking works

### Message Clarity

-   ✅ Audience understands the social engineering problem
-   ✅ Clear distinction between verified and unverified links
-   ✅ Technical sophistication is apparent
-   ✅ Real-world value proposition is clear

## Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: "How does the verification work technically?"**  
A: Uses AIR credentials and zero-knowledge proofs. Legitimate senders create cryptographic credentials that prove their identity without revealing sensitive information.

**Q: "What happens if someone tries to fake a verification?"**  
A: Impossible to fake - requires private key signatures and blockchain validation. Scammers can't generate valid proofs.

**Q: "Does this work with all email providers?"**  
A: Yes, it's a browser extension that works across Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and all web-based platforms.

**Q: "How do users get verified credentials?"**  
A: Through the Halo web app - they connect their wallet and generate verified meeting links.

**Q: "What about privacy concerns?"**  
A: Zero-knowledge proofs mean no sensitive information is exposed during verification. Only the verification result is shown.
