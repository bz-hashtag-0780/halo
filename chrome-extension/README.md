## Testing the Enhanced Extension

### Prerequisites

1. **Start the Next.js web app** (for credential generation/verification):
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

### New Test Scenarios (T3.2)

#### 1. Test Enhanced Performance

1. **Cache Performance**:

    - Click a verified link multiple times
    - Notice instant verification on repeated access
    - Check cache hits in statistics

2. **Batch Verification**:

    - Go to a page with multiple meeting links
    - Click "Batch Scan" button
    - See all links verified simultaneously

3. **Health Monitoring**:
    - Check extension popup for health status indicator
    - Should show üü¢ Healthy when all services are running
    - Try stopping the Next.js app to see üü° Degraded status

#### 2. Test Advanced Statistics

1. **Enhanced Stats Dashboard**:

    - View cache hits, API calls, and success rate
    - Success rate should be color-coded (Green >90%, Yellow >70%, Red <70%)
    - Export statistics to JSON file

2. **Cache Management**:
    - View current cache size
    - Clear cache and verify it resets to 0
    - Re-verify a link to see cache rebuild

#### 3. Test Error Handling & Resilience

1. **Network Failures**:

    - Disconnect internet during verification
    - Extension should gracefully fall back to local verification
    - Check retry count in verification results

2. **Rate Limiting**:

    - Rapidly verify many links (>10 per minute)
    - Should see rate limiting protection kick in
    - View rate limit status in cache stats

3. **Service Degradation**:
    - Stop Next.js frontend app
    - Extension should continue working with AIR API fallback
    - Health status should show degraded state

### Original Test Scenarios (Still Valid)

#### 4. Test Basic Functionality

1. Click the Halo extension icon (üõ°Ô∏è) in your toolbar
2. The popup should show:
    - Extension status with health indicator
    - Enhanced statistics with success rates
    - Current tab with security indicator (HTTPS/HTTP/localhost)
    - Advanced settings toggles

#### 5. Test Link Scanning & Verification

1. Go to any website (Gmail, Discord, etc.)
2. Create a test document or message with meeting links like:
    - `https://zoom.us/j/123456789`
    - `https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`
    - `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/`
3. Click "Scan for Links" or "Batch Scan" button
4. You should see badges appear next to meeting links on the page

#### 6. Test Verified Links

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/generate` in a new tab
2. Connect your wallet and generate a verified meeting link
3. Copy the generated link with the `halo_proof` parameter
4. Paste it somewhere (email, document, chat)
5. The extension should show a green ‚úÖ badge for verified links
